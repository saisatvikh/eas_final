## Classifying Users based upon EV Charging Patterns

With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide, understanding charging behavior and optimizing charging infrastructure is essential. This project focuses on analyzing EV charging patterns to derive meaningful insights and build a robust data product.

The primary objective is to explore and process EV charging datasets, apply machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, and develop a user-friendly application for real-time classification and insights. The project aims to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, leveraging modern tools and technologies for efficient data handling, analysis, and deployment.

Through this project, we combine data science methodologies, feature engineering, and advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver a complete data product. This includes interactive dashboards, API endpoints, and real-time data classification, ensuring practical usability for stakeholders in the EV domain.
